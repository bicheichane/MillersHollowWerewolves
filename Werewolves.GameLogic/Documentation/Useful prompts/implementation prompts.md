## apply a revision to the codebase

taking into account the current architecture as described in  @/Werewolves.Core\Documentation\architecture.md , plan out the implementation steps to apply the revision in @"/Werewolves.Core/Documentation/Revisions/2.2 - igamehooklistener polymorphism/revision.md" . And when you update the main architecture document, keep rewording to a minimum. make only the required changes necessary to make this revision clear in the updated architecture documentation. do not note any changes as belonging to this revision or make mentions like "updated", the change logs for each revision are kept separately. this architecture documentation should only reflect the latest state, not diffs or show how it progressed overtime.

## update main architecture file based on revision
update `architecture.md` based on the current implementation of `INSERT REVISION.md`, keeping rewording to a minimum. make only the required changes necessary to make this revision clear in the updated architecture documentation. do not note any changes as belonging to this revision or make mentions like "updated", the change logs for each revision are kept separately. this architecture documentation should only reflect the latest state, not diffs or show how it progressed overtime.


## roadmap implementation
plan out the required changes to implement **phase 2 step 1 (seer)** in `implementation-roadmap.md` . do not start implementing it yet. seriously and thoughtfully consider the currently defined architecture in `architecture.md` , consider if there are any changes you think would make sense to make for the implementation effort in question. if you find any, run them by me and state your case first, so I can assess whether or not I want to go forward with them.
