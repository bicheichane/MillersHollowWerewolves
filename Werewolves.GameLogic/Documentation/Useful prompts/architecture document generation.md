## generate a formal architecture revision document
make a formal architectural proposal with the following sections: abstract, motivation, proposed architectural and documentation changes, and impact analysis (benefits, considerations & mitigations). make sure it details our discussion completely, with every nuance.

##
update the original architectural change proposal minimizing rewording - only when necessary - and keeping to the same overall formal structure in order to reflect what's been discussed. make sure it details our discussion completely, with every nuance.

## revise architecture to develop a revision document

for this helper app, I am thinking about the following:
`SOMETHING`

look at the current architecture and check if you have any probing or clarifying questions about this proposed change before we proceed

## revise architecture based on developed revision

for this helper app, I am thinking about the following:
`SOMETHING`

look at the current architecture and its proposed revision and check if you have any probing or clarifying questions about this proposed change before we proceed

## revise architecture based on current code (cline)

Take a look at the architecture document @/Werewolves.GameLogic/Documentation/architecture.md  one section at a time, and for each section go into the codebase to double check if the architecture document is still up to date. If you find discrepancies, attempt to understand them and tell me what you understand changed and why it might have happened, to confirm if you are right, asking clarifying/probing questions whenever necessary. After we land on an agreement on a given section you're analyzing, you will update the documentation accordingly. Any updates to the documentation must attempt to minimize rewording of existing content unless actually necessary.

The architecture document should reflect the target final state, as the implementation isn't yet complete. Whatever is already in code must be accurately represented in the documentation, but if something additional exists in the documentation and does not contradict current implementation, it should be left alone.

Focus on the `SomeSection` section. Ignore all other ones
