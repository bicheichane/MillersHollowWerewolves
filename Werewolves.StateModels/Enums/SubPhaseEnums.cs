/// Each sub-phase must be idempotent, meaning that re-entering the same sub-phase
/// multiple times should not cause unintended side effects.
/// 
/// For example, do not have a sub-phase that starts by modifying some game state
/// and afterwards firing a hook to notify players. If the sub-phase is re-entered,
/// the game state would be modified again, leading to inconsistent behavior.
///
/// We're currently enforcing this by ensuring that each sub-phase consists of discrete stages,
/// that can only be executed once per sub-phase entry, and forcibly move to either another stage,
/// sub-phase, or main-phase.
